content: '''
  Explaination of how I should organize my work.
  
  **WIKI** contains information such as passwords (infura) and info on academic work, in theory I could recycle a lot of the content.
  
  **BLOG** Contains thoughts on interesting projects I work on and perhaps processes on workterms, but that is confidential, so be more clear.
  
  **Notes** Essentially a task list with smaller details.
  
  #### Links to Look at for June 2018
